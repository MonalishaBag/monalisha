# Flow of python program ---- flow and how we will control it.
# Conditional Statement - if, elif, else
# Iterative statement - for , while
# Transfer Statement - break, continue, pass


#Conditional : In python using based condition, we will create a flow of program.

# if statement

# syntax

# if condition:
#     statement  --- indentation

#have two number, check who biggest one.

# a = int(input('Enter a number:-')) #str
# b = int(input('Enter sec number:-'))
#
# if a>b:
#     print(a,'is biggest number')
# else:
#     print(b,'is biggest number')

# if :- if condition is correct, then execute the if statemente
#else :- if all the condition i false, then excute the else statement


#Even or Odd

# num = int(input('Enter a number:-'))
#
# if num%2 == 0:
#     print(num,'is even')
# else:
#     print(num,'is odd')


#elif:- elif used in multi conditional statement.

#have 3 number, check who is biggest one.

# a =int(input('Enter 1st number:-'))
# b =int(input('Enter 2nd number:-'))
# c =int(input('Enter 3rd number:-'))
#
# if a>b and a>c:
#     print(a, 'is biggest number')
# elif b>c:
#     print(b,'is biggest number')
# else:
#     print(c,'is biggest number')

#check the string is pallidrom or not.

# level --- level p
# even --- neve not p

# str = input('Enetr a string:-')
#
# if str == str[::-1]:
#     print(str, 'is pallindrom')
# else:
#     print(str, 'is not a pallindrom')


#if your age is below 15 then your not elgible for loan, if your age 15 -55 then your elgible. above 55 50%
#loan access.


# a=int(input('enter your age:-'))
#
# if a<15:
#     print('Sorry you are not eligible for loan')
# elif a>=15 and a<=55:
#     print('you are eligible for loan')
# else:
#     print('you are eligible for 50% loan')


#check the year is leap or not.
# year = int(input('enter the year='))
#
# if (year%100 == 0) and (year%400 ==0):
#     print(year,'is leap year')
# elif (year%4==0) and  (year%100!=0):
#     print(year,'is leap year')
# else:
#     print(year,' is not a leap year')
